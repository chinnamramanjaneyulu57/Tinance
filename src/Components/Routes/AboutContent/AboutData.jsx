        <h2>Top talent</h2>
        <p>We take extraordinary measures to have exceptional people in every seat. We ask whether each candidate will raise the average on the team before making an offer. We cast a wide net, to attract candidates from every background, focusing on both skill and culture alignment. We actively coach and develop. Unremarkable performance gets a generous severance package.</p>
        <h2>Championship team</h2>
        <p>We are a winning team, not a family, and have high expectations for performance and delivering results. We're stronger together so we choose to focus on what unites us, and not on what divides us. We have an intense work culture, and are regularly pushed out of our comfort zones. We take rest seriously, to improve productivity over the long term. Coinbase should continually earn employees' commitment and, likewise, expects employees to earn their seat at the company.</p>
        <h2>Customer focus</h2>
        <p>We are deeply focused on solving our customers' problems with technology, by enabling them to acquire, store and use crypto. We strive to be the easiest to use, most trusted and most secure platform. In every decision we make, we ask, "How does this create more value for our customers?"</p>
        <h2>Repeatable innovation</h2>
        <p>We are builders, leveraging technology to improve the world, constantly shipping ideas vs. just discussing them. We know that companies must continually reinvent themselves to avoid stagnation. We have a high tolerance for failure, investing 10% of our resources in venture bets that are uncomfortably ambitious.</p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Tinance's vision is to be the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange. Our mission is to create an open financial system and to be the leading global brand for helping people convert crypto into and out of their local currency.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p> Our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world.</p>
        <h2>Positive energy</h2>
        <p>We are optimistic about the future and determined to get there. We co-create solutions instead of choosing blame and criticism. We create moments of play at work.</p>
        <h2>Mission first</h2>
        <p>‍Our mission is ambitious and important. We don’t engage in social or political activism that is unrelated to our mission while at work. We seek to make the workplace a refuge from division, so we can stay focused on making progress toward the mission.</p>
        <h2>Clear communication</h2>
        <p>We are direct and succinct. We share information efficiently, improving collaboration and productivity. We practice active listening.</p>
        <h2>Efficient execution</h2>
        <p>We have a bias for action. We complete high quality work quickly. We focus on the 20% of work that will get us 80% of the impact.</p>
        <h2>Act like an owner</h2>
        <p>We take 100% responsibility for achieving the mission. We seek to improve all aspects of our company even in ways that are not explicitly part of our job.</p>
        <h2>Continuous learning</h2>
        <p>We're humble, and value learning over being right. We embrace delivering and receiving candid feedback, and see every setback as an opportunity to learn.</p>
